# How to contribute

One of the easiest ways to contribute is to participate in discussions on GitHub issues. You can also contribute by submitting pull requests with code changes.

## Bugs, feature requests, feedback, and general discussions?
Start a discussion on the [repository issue tracker](https://github.com/modernuo/modernuo/issues).

## Reporting security issues and bugs
Security issues and bugs should be reported privately, via email, to hi@modernuo.com.
You should receive a response within 24 hours.
If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message.

## Other discussions
Our team members also monitor several other discussion forums:

* [ModernUO Discord](https://discord.gg/NUhe7Pq9gF)
