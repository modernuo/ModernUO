        /* Security at the Crystal Cave<BR><BR>
         *
         * We have taken great measuresto ensure the safety of the
         * Scroll of Calling, which we have so valiantly taken from
         * the Necromancer Maabus during the battle of the wood
         * nearly 200 years ago.<BR><BR>
         *
         * The scroll must never fall into the hands of the
         * Necromancers again, lest they use it to summon the ancient
         * daemon Kronus.  The scroll of calling is a necessity in the
         * series of dark rites the Necromancers must perform to once again
         * re-awaken Kronus.<BR><BR>
         *
         * Should Kronus ever rise again, the days of the Paladins, and
         * indeed humanity as we know it will be numbered.<BR><BR>
         *
         * For this reason, we have posted the honorable Horus, former
         * General of the Northern Legions to guard the entrance of the
         * Crystal Cave where we keep the Scroll of Calling.  Horus was
         * infused with magical life from the tree Urywen during his last
         * battle.  The power gave him eternal life, but it also,
         * unfortunately, took his eye sight.<BR><BR>
         *
         * Since Horus cannot see those he admits to the Crystal Cave,
         * he will only allow those that know the secret password to enter.
         * Speak the following word to Horus and he shall grant you passage
         * to the Crystal Cave:<BR><BR>
         *
         * <I>Urywen</I><BR><BR>
         *
         * Do not speak this password anywhere except when seeking passage
         * into the Crystal Cave, as our adversaries are lurking in the
         * shadows ' they are everywhere.<BR><BR>Go with the light, friend.<BR><BR>
         *
         * <I>- Frater Melkeer</I>
