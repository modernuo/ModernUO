This skill helps you lessen the severity of spells that lower your stats or ones that last for a specific duration of time. It does not lessen damage from spells such as Energy Bolt or Flamestrike.<BR><BR>The Magery spells that can be resisted are Clumsy, Curse, Feeblemind, Mana Drain, Mana Vampire, Paralyze, Paralyze Field, Poison, Poison Field, and Weaken.<BR><BR>The Necromancy spells that can be resisted are Blood Oath, Corpse Skin, Mind Rot, and Pain Spike.<BR><BR>At higher ranks, the Resisting Spells skill also benefits you by adding a bonus to your minimum elemental resists. This bonus is only applied after all other resist modifications - such as from equipment - has been calculated. It's also not cumulative. It compares the number of your minimum resists to the calculated value of your modifications and uses the higher of the two values.<BR><BR>As you can see, Resisting Spells is a difficult skill to understand, and even more difficult to master.

Those of us who study the art of Meditation are also known as stotics.

Metal armor inerferes with the regenerative properties of Meditation. It is wise to wear leather or cloth protection when meditating. Head east out of town and go to Old Haven.

Remember, you will need blank scrolls as well. Do this until you have raised your Inscription skill to 50.<br><center>------</center><br>Greetings and welcome to the New Haven Magery Library! You wish to learn how to scribe spell scrolls? You have come to the right place! Inscribed in a steady hand and imbued with the power of reagents, a scroll can mean the difference between life and death in a perilous situation. Those knowledgeable in Inscription may transcribe spells to create useful and valuable magical scrolls.<BR><BR>Before you inscribe a spell, you must first be able to cast the spell without the aid of a scroll. This means that you need the appropriate level of proficiency as a mage, the required mana, and the required reagents. Second, you will need a blank scroll to write on and a scribe's pen. Then, you will need to decide which particular spell you wish to scribe. It may sound easy, but there is a bit more to it. As with the development of all skills, you need to practice Inscription of lower level spells before you can move onto the more difficult ones.<BR><BR>The most important aspect of Inscription is mana. Inscribing a scroll with a magic spell drains your mana. When inscribing 3rd circle or lower spells this will not be much of a problem for these spells consume a small amount of mana. However, when you are inscribing higher circle spells, you may see your mana drain rapidly. When this happens, pause or meditate before continuing.<BR><BR>I suggest you begin scribing any 3rd and 4th circle spells that you know. If you don't possess any, you can always barter with one of the local mage merchants or a fellow adventurer that is a seasoned Scribe.<BR><BR>Come back to me once you feel that you are worthy of the rank of Apprentice Scribe and I will reward you with an arcane prize.

Clear your mind, focus, and note any tracks in the ground or sounds in the air that can help you find your mark. You can do it, friend. I have faith in you.<br><br>Come back to me once you have achieved the rank of Apprentice Ranger (for Tracking), and I will give you something that may help you in your travels. Take care, friend.
